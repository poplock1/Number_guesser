# Number guesser
Program that guesses drawn digit using simple neural network model created by following Tensorflow tutorial.
Be aware that the model is not yet optimized and data provided by user input is slighly different than data that it was trained on so there will be some issues with recognizing digits.

## Tools and technologies :
* Python
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pygame

## Installation and setup : 
You can use command prompt to install all necessary packages 
```shell
pyton -m pip r install_packages.txt
```

## Instructions :
Press SPACE to guess\
Press C to clear board\
Press ESC to exit program

## Heading for : 
* Optimizing input data for better recogniction
* Optimizing model

## Features : 
* Object oriented
* Basic and user-friendly UI
